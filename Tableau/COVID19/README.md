# 🦠 Global COVID-19 Analysis (Tableau Project)

## 📘 Project Overview
This project analyzes the **global impact of COVID-19 (2019–2021)** by exploring confirmed cases, death rates, and infection distribution across continents and countries.  
The goal is to visualize how the virus spread geographically and to identify regions with the highest mortality and infection trends.

The dataset is based on the **COVID-19 Global Data** used in *Alex The Analyst’s Data Analyst Portfolio Project*,  
and all visualizations were built using **Tableau Public**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Visualize the **global infection distribution** using an interactive map  
- Compare **total death counts per continent**  
- Show **infection growth trends** and apply **forecasting (2020–2021)**  
- Calculate **overall global metrics** (cases, deaths, death percentage)  
- Identify which countries experienced the fastest infection increases
